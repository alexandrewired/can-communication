CAN bus is a robust, standardized communication protocol originally developed for the automotive industry. It enables various electronic components—such as sensors, actuators, and control units—to communicate reliably even in harsh environments. This project explains the underlying principles and provides a practical example of setting up CAN communication between ESP32 boards.

CAN Bus differential Signaling - CAN bus uses two differential signal lines—CAN High (CAN-H) and CAN Low (CAN-L)—plus a common ground.
